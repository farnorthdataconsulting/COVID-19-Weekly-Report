### <em>COVID-19 and Vaccination</em> {.unlisted .unnumbered}
* 71.2% of Alaska residents aged ≥5 years have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Among those who completed the primary vaccine series, 50.2% of Alaska residents ≥18 years have received their booster. Learn more about COVID-19 vaccination coverage in Alaska on the <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/a7e8be4adbe740a1bad1393894ee4075/" target="_blank">Vaccine Dashboard</a>. Learn more about <a href="https://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/epi/id/pages/covid-19/vaccineappointments.aspx" target="_blank">COVID-19 vaccines</a>.
* Vaccines help protect against infection and against severe disease, especially when a person is up to date on vaccinations. During the 4-week period from February 6, 2022–March 5, 2022, unvaccinated Alaskans were 7.3 times more likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19 than Alaskans who are up to date on COVID-19 vaccination (i.e., completed the primary series and received a booster dose, if eligible) and 2.9 times more likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19 than Alaskans who completed the primary vaccination series but are not up to date. These estimates are lagged by one week to partially account for the time it takes to document hospitalizations. (See the <a href="https://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/Epi/id/siteassets/pages/HumanCoV/COVID_monthly_update.pdf" target="_blank">monthly report</a> for more data and analysis through January.)

* Among Alaska residents aged ≥5 years from January 16, 2021–March 12, 2022, 69,054 cases were documented in persons who had completed the primary series and were considered fully vaccinated. Among those vaccine-breakthrough cases, 515 hospitalizations and 180 deaths due to COVID-19 have been recorded. During that time, 98,276 cases have been documented in unvaccinated Alaskans aged ≥5 years, leading to 1,836 hospitalizations and 642 deaths. All data are preliminary and subject to change.
* During the Omicron wave, the incidence of COVID-19 cases in vaccinated persons has become more similar to the incidence in unvaccinated persons. This trend likely reflects multiple factors which may include: immunity wanes over time, cases in vaccinated persons may be more likely to be detected than cases in unvaccinated persons, and there may be increased infection-induced immunity especially among unvaccinated persons.

* Right now, most influenza in Alaska is caused by influenza A.
24% of Alaskans aged ≥10 years have been vaccinated against seasonal influenza. It is not too late to get vaccinated against influenza.

## Emergency Department Visits
### <em>Visits with COVID-like or Influenza-like Illness</em> {.unlisted .unnumbered}
* Syndromic surveillance consists of analyzing data on symptoms and diagnoses among patients visiting emergency departments in Alaska. The main goal is to identify trends. Unlike case-based surveillance, syndromic surveillance does not depend on laboratory testing.
* Influenza-like illness (ILI) is defined as having a fever and at least one other symptom, such cough or sore throat. Patients with a diagnosis of influenza are also included, regardless of symptoms.
* COVID-like illness (CLI) encompasses a broader array of respiratory and other symptoms than influenza-like illness. This category also includes any patient with a diagnosis of COVID-19, regardless of symptoms.
* Patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 are excluded from the ILI category and, likewise, patients with a diagnosis of influenza are excluded from the CLI category. But a patient without a diagnosis for either could be included in both the CLI and ILI categories. CLI and ILI may be caused by respiratory viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus.
* As the Delta variant wave waned in Alaska in late October and November 2021, the percentage of emergency department patients with CLI declined. However, it increased in mid-December, reaching its peak in mid-January. Now, it is at a level lower than that observed in December before the Omicron wave. The percentage of emergency department patients with CLI the week of March 27–April 2 remained similar to the percentage recorded the prior week.
* ILI levels increased in December but have since decreased from the late-December peak, remaining steady over the last few weeks.
